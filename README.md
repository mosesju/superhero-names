# First project with Open AI

Found a really cool API, which allows users to generate texta and do a lot more. I modified the quickstart code to generate superhero names vs. pet names. 
The most important challenge from this was to understand how the AI processes. Most of the time was spent tinkering to get results that would provide interesting results. Initially I kept getting names like "the incredible hulk" or "Spider man" while I actually wanted to have made up hero names. 
Will spend a minute to deploy on netlify soon.
